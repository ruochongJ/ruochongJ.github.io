            <h2><a href="/articles/xword/">What I learned about research from crossword puzzles</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I’ve been doing crossword puzzles daily for many years. Apart from doing a puzzle before grad school exams to warm up my neurons, I never saw much of a connection between puzzles and my day job as a professor of data science. But lately I’ve noticed that many of the habits and attitudes I developed as a solver are also relevant to research. Here’s a&nbsp;summary.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>There have been a number of papers at <span class="caps">NIPS</span> that use <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.1901.pdf">Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</a>, and I thought I’d share a Javascript implementation of the algorithm that I wrote a couple years ago. It can be a fairly opaque algorithm when described mathematically, and I found it really useful to see it working. It turns out it’s kind of&nbsp;mesmerizing.</p>

I was recently invited by the Information Science students to give the faculty address for our department. Here’s a lightly edited&nbsp;transcript.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>There was a conversation on Twitter about the current state of <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu">Mallet</a>. My goal for Mallet is that it should do a few things very well. Future development will focus on making the process of using machine learning easier and more informative. Also, be sure to use the current <a href="https://github.com/mimno/Mallet">GitHub</a>&nbsp;version.</p>
