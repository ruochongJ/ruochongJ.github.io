											<h3>Why am I interested in causal inference</h3>
											<p>People are curious about the relationship between causes and results. However, it's ambiguous and  difficult to find the relationship directly from the data. Learning causal inference can help us to accurately describe the causal relationship, especially in mathematical language, to find out the real causal relationship between things, so as to help us make decisions or better understand the connection between things in real life.</p>
